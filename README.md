## Introduction

In this project, we've recreated a classic arcade game where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. The goal is to prevent the ball from going past your paddle while scoring points by making the ball pass your opponent's paddle.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay with intuitive controls.
- Responsive paddles and bouncing ball for an engaging gaming experience.
- Dynamic scoring system with updates on the scoreboard.
